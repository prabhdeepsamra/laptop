## The "janktop"

I hacked together a "laptop" by combining an old desktop computer and the monitor from a broken laptop. It's more of a portable desktop, but the idea is there. Is it practial? Not really, no. Was it fun? Yes. 

This was supposed to be a prototype project, hence why I used an old pre-built system. It was the cheapest way of testing my idea.


## The Computer

Here it is in its full glory

### The parts
LCD Screen - I ripped this from an old, broken laptop - $0

[LCD Controller Board](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Kit-for-LP156WH2-TLQB-LCD-LED-Lvds-Controller-Board-HDMI-DVI-VGA/112415296844?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649)  - This part let me input to the LCD Screen - $20

Dell OptiPlex 760 - Core2 Duo E8400 (3Gz), 2GB DDR2 RAM, onboard graphics, etc. - $30

Wood - $10


### The process
The first thing I did when I recieved the desktop in the mail was take it apart (stupidly on my part, before even making sure it even worked) to see how much space could be saved. It was at this point I decided to build the case out of wood on account of how heavy the metal case was.
